1. Introduction:
Moki - Shopify Helper
This extension helps generate product descriptions for Shopify stores using the Google Gemini API.
2. Information We Collect and How We Use It:

Gemini API Key:
The extension requires you to provide your own Google Gemini API key.
This API key is stored locally on your computer using Chrome's secure storage (chrome.storage.sync) and is only used to make API calls to the Google Gemini service on your behalf.
We do not have access to, collect, or transmit your API key to any servers other than directly to Google's Gemini API endpoints as required for the extension's functionality.

Product Information:
To generate descriptions, the extension reads the following information from the active Shopify product admin page when you use its features: product title, existing product description, and (if the feature is used) product images.
This information is sent to the Google Gemini API to generate new content.
This product information is processed ephemerally for the purpose of content generation and is not stored by this extension beyond the immediate API request/response cycle, nor is it collected or stored by the developers of this extension.
The extension does not collect any other personal information, browsing history, or user activity.

3. Data Sharing:
Apart from sending your API key and product information to the Google Gemini API as described above, we do not share any data handled by the extension with any other third parties.
Please refer to Google's Privacy Policy for information on how Google handles data sent to its Gemini API.

4. Data Security:
Your Gemini API key is stored locally using Chrome's built-in storage mechanisms. While we strive to use acceptable means to protect your information, remember that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.

5. Changes to This Privacy Policy:
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
